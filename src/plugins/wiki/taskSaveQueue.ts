// The serialised save queue behind wiki task-checkbox toggles (#775),
// extracted from useWikiPageSave so its intricate ordering rules can be
// unit-tested without a Vue runtime. The composable keeps only the DOM /
// optimistic-update glue; every decision below is pure control flow over
// injected dependencies.
//
// The rules, in one place:
//   - Each click queues onto the previous save (a slow network can't
//     reorder writes).
//   - A `generation` counter invalidates saves whose captured snapshot was
//     computed against optimistic state that a failure-triggered refresh
//     has since discarded.
//   - A page switch mid-flight (checked before AND after the request)
//     abandons the save — writing this page's snapshot onto a different
//     page would clobber unrelated state.
//   - On failure the generation bump happens AFTER refresh completes, so
//     clicks that arrived WHILE the refresh was in flight (they captured
//     the pre-bump generation) are invalidated too.
//   - The chain is self-healing: a rejected persist must not leave the
//     chain permanently rejected (which would silently drop every later
//     click).
//   - A persist that THROWS (rather than returning `{ ok: false }`) is
//     converted to a network-level failure so it still reaches onError,
//     instead of being swallowed silently by the self-healing `.catch`.
